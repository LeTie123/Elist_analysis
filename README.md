# Portfolio Project Elist E-commerce Analysis

In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset containing more than 100,000 orders since 2019 til 2024.  I investigated trends in sales, orders, products, and the effectiveness of the company's loyalty program to provide insight that could improve the companies performance. I utilized various functions within Excel including conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and Pivot Tables to clean and analyze the data and provide insight to management.


##Overview
The Elist data set has shown that the company is showing a decrease in sells revenue. However the decrease in sells should not be a big concern due to rare anomolies that had affected the economic market during 2020 and the current sales data is showing that the companies is returning to how it has done before. A deep dive also reviewed that the companies main time for sales is during the holiday season such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, but sales are stagnate during the rest of the year or lower than normal. Apple Airpods are the companies best sellers, while the Bose Soundsport Headphones are the the worst sellers. The loyalty program is building a bigger customer base and is shown to be popular amoung the customer base.



## Summary of Analysis
**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the total sales value was 28 million with over 100,000 orders. 2020 accounted for more than 35% of the total value with the highest yearly sales total of $10.1 million and average order values (AOV) around $300. Sales and orders have been on a decline since 2020 with rates decreasing by roughly 10% and 46% for 2021 and 2022. However, AOV has only decreased by roughly 10% each year. It is assumed that the enforced lockdown and increased stimulus spending may have had the greatest factor in such increased in 2020 and slowly exiting in 2021.

**Monthly Trends:** Analysis reveals that E-list sales does have seasonality. November and December tend to average around a 21% growth rate compared to other months. February and October shows the biggest decrease in growth avaergaing around -25%. Trends most likely occur due to customers saving for the big holidays in November and December and regressing from wanting to purchase anything new after the holidays. March 2020 was deemed to be an outlier due to having a growth rate of 50% in total sales, most likely stemming from pandemic spending.

**Loyalty Program** 
The loyalty program started off slow but has steadily gained popularity throughout the years based on the customer breakdown with loyalty memebrs in 2021 and 2022 making up more than 50% of the customer base. The company's current members account for 42% of the grand total. Loyalty members have also outperformed non-loyalty members in 2021 and 2022, with each years loyalty revenue bringing in $500k more than non-loyalty.

**Refund Rate**

## Recommendations
Based on the above insights, the company should looking into the following:

* Reach out to sales team or marketing teams to determine if it is possible to promote sales during down time such as non-holiday seasons to help increase interest
* Drop Bose Soundsport Headphones from inventory due to accounting for less than 1% of revenue and prioritize other high selling products to increase profit margins
* Due to increasing popularity, continue to promote loyalty program because the program is continuing to bring in more customer and revenue than non-loyalty
