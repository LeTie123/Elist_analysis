# Portfolio Project Elist E-commerce Analysis

In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset contaning more than 100,000 orders since 2019 til 2024.  I investigated trends in sales, orders, products, and the effectiveness of the company's marketing usage to provide insight that could improve the companies performance. I utalized various functions within Excel including conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and Pivot Tables to clean and analyze the data and provide insight to management.

## Overview of Analysis
**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the total sales value was 28 million with over 100,000 orders. 2020 accounted for more than 35% of the total value with the highest yearly sales total of $10.1 million and average order values (AOV) around $300. Sales and orders have been on a decline since 2020 with rates decreasing by roughly 10% and 46% for 2021 and 2022. However, AOV has only decreased by roughly 10% each year. It is assumed that the enforced lockdown and increased stimulus spending may have had the greatest factor in such increased in 2020 sales. 

**Monthly Trends:** Analysis reveals that E-list sales does have seasonality. November and December tend to average around a 21% growth rate compared to other months. February and October shows the biggest decrease in growth avaergaing around -25%. Trends most likely occur due to customers saving for the big holidays in November and December and regressing from wanting to purchase anything new after the holidays. March 2020 was deemed to be an outlier due to having a growth rate of 50% in total sales most likely due to pandemic spending.
